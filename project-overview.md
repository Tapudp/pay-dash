# Project Overview

## Backend

The backend is organized into the following structure:

- **Routes:** Define the API endpoints and their corresponding controllers.
- **Controllers:** Handle the logic for processing requests from the routes.
- **Services:** Contain business logic, interacting with models and external services.
- **Utils:** Host utility functions such as error handlers and loggers.
- **Constants:** Store constants used throughout the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend follows a structured organization:

- **app.js:** The main entry point of the frontend application.
- **Containers:** Hold page-level components, such as the Home component.
- **Components:** House individual UI components along with their corresponding CSS files.
- **Service:** Manages API calls and communication with the backend.
- **Constants:** Stores constant values used across the frontend.
- **config.js:** Contains important configurations for external connections.
- **Context:** Implements a React context to maintain authenticated user details.

This structure aims to enhance readability, maintainability, and scalability of both the backend and frontend components.

## Future Enhancements

- **Common Customized Request Validator:** Implement a common request validator for standardized input validation.
- **Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests for all service functions and frontend components to ensure robustness.
- **Cloud Logger:** Attach a logger to a cloud service for centralized logging and easier debugging.
- **Application Layer Cache Mechanism:** Introduce an application layer cache mechanism that can be extended to utilize among multiple instances of the API service, enhancing performance and scalability.
